# MyReads Project

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This is the MyReads website that enables you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading or want to read. 

Note: Functionality was added to show a Modal pop-up display details of the book. Click on the book cover to see the modal pop=up with the details.

## Installation Requirements

The following steps need to be followed:

1) Clone or download project from Github https://github.com/sscanni/My-Read-Project
2) install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3) This website uses body-scroll-lock to lock scrolling when the modal window is displayed. body-scroll-lock must be installed:

    `npm install body-scroll-lock`

## To View Website
